[*][COLOR=#009900][B]Q.[/B] The map does not change after player wins[/color]
         [COLOR=#FF0000][B]A.[/B][/color] GunGame plugin doesn't change the map itself, it leaves that to whatever mapchanger you use.
After player reaches one of the latest levels GunGame will attempt to run the command that is located in "gungame.mapvote.cfg" to start map voting.
By default it tries SourceMod default plugin to start the vote (MapChooser) - "sm_mapvote", but you can change that by changing the file "gungame.mapvote.cfg".

See "VoteLevelLessWeaponCount" config variable in main gungame config file. By deafult it equals two.
That means the voting begins after someone level up to the level that 2 levels below the maximum level.

After someone wins the game GunGame finishes map like it happens when "mp_timelimit" exceeded. Then your map changing plugin should change the map.

You need to configure your map voting/map changing plugin according to its documentation.
For example SourceMod Map Management Plugins documentation is here [URL]https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Map_Management_Plugins_(SourceMod)[/URL].
It uses some of the config files:
"/maplist.txt"
"/mapcycle.txt"
"/cfg/sourcemod/mapchooser.cfg"
"/cfg/sourcemod/mapvote.cfg"

You can also try UltimateMapChooser plugin [URL]https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=134190[/URL]
If you are having issues with CS:GO you can try workaround - "EndGameSilent" "1" in main gungame config file. 
If you are running CS:GO, make sure to set the correct game mode (find in the FAQ).

[*][COLOR=#009900][B]Q.[/B][CS:GO] What do I put for game_mode and game_type?[/color]
         [COLOR=#FF0000][B]A.[/B][/color]+game_type 0 +game_mode 0

        [COLOR=#FF0000][B]A.[/B][/color] [URL]http://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=1075809&postcount=865[/URL]

[*][COLOR=#009900][B]Q.[/B] Sound does not work.[/color]
         [COLOR=#FF0000][B]A.[/B][/color] Try to change all slashes ("/") in sound files paths to double-backslashes ("\\") 
         in gungame.config.txt and restart server and client.

[*][COLOR=#009900][B]Q.[/B] Sound still does not work.[/color]
         [COLOR=#FF0000][B]A.[/B][/color] Good article for beginning [url]http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Pure_Servers[/url]
         Post your question with the following info: output of the command on server "sv_pure",
         output of the command on client "sv_pure" or content of the file "cstrike/pure_server_whitelist.txt",
         output of the command "sv_downloadurl" on server or client.

[*][COLOR=#009900][B]Q.[/B] Weapons desapearing on level up and player spawn.[/color]
         [COLOR=#FF0000][B]A.[/B][/color] If you are using DeathMatch:SM then set [b]sm_ggdm_removeweapons "0"[/b] in [b]server.cfg[/b] and
         set [b]"StripDeadPlayersWeapon" "1"[/b] in [b]gungame.config.txt[/b]. GunGame:SM weapon stripper is much cpu effective
         then DeathMatch:SM weapon stripper, don't use DeathMatch:SM weapon stripper with GunGame:SM, it was designed for non GunGame servers.

[*][COLOR=#009900][B]Q.[/B] I level up on two levels at once.[/color]
        [COLOR=#FF0000][B]A.[/B][/color] Double check that you have only gungame_sdhooks.smx OR gungame.smx in your plugin folder.
        Not both of them. If you have both you have to delete one of them.

[*][COLOR=#009900][B]Q.[/B] I have strange errors in my logs.[/color]
        [COLOR=#FF0000][B]A.[/B][/color] First of all read this error messages carefully. Sometimes log messages has recommendations how to fix
        the issue. Double check that you have only gungame_sdhooks.smx OR gungame.smx in your plugin folder. Not both of them.
        If you have both you have to delete one of them.

[*][COLOR=#009900][B]Q.[/B] I have updated the plugin, and something does not work.[/color]
        [COLOR=#FF0000][B]A.[/B][/color] First of all update weaponinfo.txt.
        Notice, that since version 1.2.0.0 the cfg directory changed it's location from cfg/gungame/ to cfg/gungame/css/ (cfg/gungame/csgo/).
        You can use your old gungame.config.txt and gungame.equip.txt, but you should update new weaponinfo.txt from the release zip file.

[*][COLOR=#009900][B]Q.[/B] Server has been updated and gungame does not work.[/color]
        [COLOR=#FF0000][B]A.[/B][/color] If you have gungame version earlier then 1.2.0.0, you should update to the 1.2.0.0 version or later.
        Notice, that since version 1.2.0.0 the cfg directory changed it's location from cfg/gungame/ to cfg/gungame/css/ (cfg/gungame/csgo/).
        You can use your old gungame.config.txt and gungame.equip.txt, but you should update new weaponinfo.txt from the release zip file.

[*][COLOR=#009900][B]Q.[/B] How do i enable feature X?[/color]
        [COLOR=#FF0000][B]A.[/B][/color] All config files are very good described and documented. Before asking such a question you should read 
        commets in gungame.config.txt and gungame.equip.txt for all config variables.

[*][COLOR=#009900][B]Q.[/B] Something does not work, what should i do?[/color]
        [COLOR=#FF0000][B]A.[/B][/color] Start with posting your output of server commands "version; meta version; sm version; plugin_print; meta list; sm exts list;sm plugins list"
        and content of the latest file [B]cstrike/addons/sourcemod/logs/errors_<date>.log[/B] in this topic.

[*][COLOR=#009900][B]Q.[/B] Where the stats database is located?[/color]
        [COLOR=#FF0000][B]A.[/B][/color] If you did not configure any custom databases, you gungame stats is located in 
        [B]addons\sourcemod\data\sqlite\sourcemod-local.sq3[/B].

[*][COLOR=#009900][B]Q.[/B] How to convert my ES GG 5.1 winners database file into SM GG database?[/color]
        [COLOR=#FF0000][B]A.[/B][/color] 
            1) Install php (from http://php.net) into [b]C:\programs\php[/b] folder.
            2) Copy [b]C:\programs\php\php.ini-development[/b] into [b]C:\programs\php\php.ini[/b] file.
            3) Uncomment 2 lines in [b]C:\programs\php\php.ini[/b]:
            3.1) [b]extension_dir = "ext"[/b]
            3.2) [b]extension=php_sqlite3.dll[/b]
            4) Run [b]C:\programs\php\php.exe tools\convert_winners_esgg51_to_ggsm.php <input.db> <output.db>[/b]
            where [b]input.db[/b] is your ES GG 5.1 sqlite winners database file, 
            and [b]output.db[/b] is you SM GG  sqlite winners database file, that is usualy located in
            [b]addons\sourcemod\data\sqlite\sourcemod-local.sq3[/b].
